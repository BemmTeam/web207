          Founded in 2013, Start Bootstrap has been the most popular library of free, open source Bootstrap themes on the web for over seven years. At the very start, the mission was simply to create and share free, open source, and easy to download Bootstrap themes without sacrificing quality. To this day, we still prioritize our one-click downloads without having to enter any information, and we use the MIT license for our free products so you don't have to use our name in the footer of your website.

Up until 2020, Start Bootstrap only featured free products with development supported by minimal advertising and affiliate partnerships. In 2020 however, after numerous requests for the past seven years, we began creating premium, paid products that were much more comprehensive and fully tooled versions of some of our most popular freebies.

Moving forward, we will be focusing on maintaining the quality and design of our free, open source products along with our new, more powerful pro products. Thank you for visiting Start Bootstrap!
